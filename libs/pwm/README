This PWM library is intended to make development of code using the pwm
peripheral faster for simple uses by people who already have an 
undestanding of the PWM module architecture.

The PWM module consists of 4 generators each with two PWM signal
outputs. 

The clock is set on a module level from the system clock with 
a divider. This divider allows for signal periods up to about 80 ms.

The PWM signal period is set on a generator level, which means that
pairs of outputs will share periods. 

The PWM duty can be set on a per output basis.

For usage details see the pwm.h file.
