/*
 * This module implements context switch on ARMv7-M for RTOS variants that support task preemption by exceptions.
 *
 * RTOS variants with preemption support need, in addition to the ability to trigger a context switch internally from
 * within the RTOS, also a mechanism for allowing user-defined exception handlers to trigger a context switch.
 * To implement context switch for preemption-supporting variants on ARMv7-M, we use the PendSV and SVCall exceptions.
 *
 * Invoking the 'svc' instruction immediately causes the SVCall exception to occur, which makes it ideal for use in
 * implementing voluntary context switch (or 'yield') requested internally by the RTOS.
 * This is most typically used just after the RTOS has changed the set of schedulable tasks, for example by blocking
 * the current task.
 *
 * We use the PendSV exception to implement an involuntary context switch (or 'preemption') as follows.
 * When a user-defined exception handler returns true, indicating that a preemption should occur, we write to the
 * 'PendSV set-pending bit' in the Interrupt Control and State Register (ICSR), which will cause a PendSV exception to
 * occur at the first opportunity that it is enabled (which may be immediately, or as soon as it is re-enabled).
 * The advantage of using PendSV in this manner is that by raising the value of the Base Priority Mask Register
 * (BASEPRI) to the priority of the PendSV exception, the RTOS can temporarily disable it (and thus, preemption)
 * internally in order to ensure correct behavior, without having to disable interrupts globally.
 *
 * The handlers we define for PendSV and SVCall are very similar, in that they both invoke the scheduler to discover
 * the next task to be scheduled, then carry out a context switch to that task if it is different to the current one.
 * Where they differ is in their handling of the preemption-enabled/disabled status of the task.
 * To ensure correct behavior, we must store this status in the context stack frame of a task when context switching
 * away from it, and then accurately restore it upon context switching back to the task.
 * Because the PendSV exception occurs as a result of the preemption-pending status being set simultaneously with
 * preemption being enabled, we expect preemption to be enabled when entering the PendSV handler.
 * In contrast, SVCall occurs voluntarily from within the RTOS, and we require and expect the RTOS to ensure
 * preemption is disabled when invoking the 'svc' instruction and entering the SVCall handler.
