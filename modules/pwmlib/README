PWM generator modification

questions for seb:
    are the pwm pins dedicated?
        if so should the gpio setup be done in boilerplate?
        if not is there going to be a some system for locking pins for use?
    are we using both pwm modules?
    do we have a naming scheme for the pwm pins?
    latest generic pcb diagrams?
    what sort of config inputs would be preferable?
        seconds/hertz vs clock cycles
        duty as counts or percent/unit interval
    are all boards going to be working at the same clock speed?
    what range of pwm frequencies are we going to be working at?
        will we need to use different pwm clock divisors?
    are we using pin asserted fault conditions?
    does the pwm alignment matter for anything we're doing?
    are we ever going to need deadbanding?
