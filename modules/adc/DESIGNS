Continuous sampling
    - Add desired inputs to the sample sequencer and buffer the output
    - Function to retrieve value from buffer for specific input

Initialisation:
    1. Enable ADC clock if not enabled
    2. Enable GPIO clock if not enabled
    3. Set GPIO AFSEL bit ?
    4. Clear GPIO DEN bit in GPIODEN
    5. Disable analogue isolation via GPIOAMSEL
    6. Disable sample sequencer via ASENn in ADCACTSS
    7. Append new source to sequencer via ADCSSCTLn
    8. Enable sample sequencer via ASENn in ADCACTSS

Questions:
    Sample sequence trigger?
        Run off spare PWM module?
    Interrupt configuration/interrupts at all?
    Hardware/software averaging based on sampling frequency?
    Sampling frequency?

Should all be doable with the tiva libraries.

Notes
    - ADC should use PIOSC for clock at 1 divider for clock
