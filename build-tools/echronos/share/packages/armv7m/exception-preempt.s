/* This module generates a series of 'trampolines' that can be installed as exception vectors (using the
 * armv7m.vectable module).
 *
 * A trampoline calls an underlying handler function, and if the handler returns true it will preempt the existing
 * task by raising the 'PendSV' exception.
 *
 * Preemption can be disabled by raising the base priority (msr basepri) to that of the PendSV exception.
 * See ctxt-switch-preempt.s for more details. */
