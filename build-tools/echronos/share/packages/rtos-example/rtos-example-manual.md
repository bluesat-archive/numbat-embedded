</dl>

RTOS variant-agnostic program modules in this package take a non-optional `variant` configuration element that must be supplied to them by the system `.prx` file, so that they can include the correct RTOS variant header.

For example, when building `rtos-example.timer-test` for the Kochab variant:

    <module name="rtos-example.timer-test">
      <variant>kochab</variant>
    </module>


`signal-demo`
====================

This system demonstrates signal functionality on variants that support priority scheduling:

  Part 0 has one task (A) demonstrate peeking and polling of signals, as well as waits returning immediately if a signal in the set is already available.

  Part 1 shows a higher priority task (A) block waiting on a signal set, and being unblocked by a lower priority task (B) sending it signals in the set.
  Signals not in the set will not wake task (A), but will remain pending such that (A) will return immediately if it tries to wait on them subsequently.

There is no LED activity in this system, only debug prints via GDB.
The following is the expected output of the signal demo, continuing from a breakpoint set at `rtos_start`:

    (gdb) c
    Continuing.

    Part 0: Solo

    a: setting all signals
    a: peeking/polling specific signals
    a: checking for stray signals

    Done.


`kochab-mutex-demo`
===================

This system demonstrates the Kochab variant's mutex functionality, whose behavior is subject to priority scheduling with priority inheritance:

  Part 0 has one task (A) demonstrate trying and releasing of a mutex, as well as taking of a mutex when the mutex is available.

  Part 1 shows a lower priority task (B) unblocking a higher priority task (A) by releasing a mutex it is blocked waiting on.

  Part 2 demonstrates the lowest-priority task (Z) inheriting the priority of the highest priority task (A), due to task (Z) holding a mutex that task (A) is blocked waiting on.
  Thus, task (Z) is scheduled over tasks (B) and (Y), despite them normally having a priority higher than task (Z).

  Part 3 demonstrates that priority inheritance is transitive.
  Task (A) is blocked by one mutex held by task (Y), and task (Y) is blocked by another mutex held by task (Z).
  Therefore, task (Z) inherits the priority of task (A) via task (Y), and is thus scheduled ahead of task (B), even though task (B) normally has a higher priority than both (Y) and (Z).

  Part 4 demonstrates that if two tasks (B) and (Y) are both waiting to acquire a mutex, the higher-priority task (B) will be given ownership of the mutex in preference to the lower-priority task (Y).

  Part 5 demonstrates that the higher-priority task (B) will be given preference over the lower priority task (Y) regardless of which of the two tasks attempted to acquire the mutex first.

  Part 6 demonstrates a lock attempt on a mutex by task (B) timing out due to task (A) not unlocking the mutex until after the requested timeout has expired.

  Part 7 demonstrates a lock attempt on a mutex by task (B) succeeding before its timeout due to task (A) unlocking the mutex within the requested time.

There is no LED activity in this system, only debug prints via GDB.
The following is the expected output of the mutex demo, continuing from a breakpoint set at `rtos_start`:

    (gdb) c

`phact-mutex-demo`
===================

This system demonstrates the Phact variant's mutex functionality, whose behavior is subject to priority ceiling protocol scheduling:

  Part 0 has one task (A) demonstrate trying and releasing of a mutex, as well as taking of a mutex when the mutex is available.

  Part 1 has four tasks (A, B, Y, and Z) taking turns to lock a mutex whose priority ceiling is higher than all of their task priorities.
  It also shows that upon releasing such a mutex, a task will immediately revert to its original priority, implicitly yielding to the highest-priority runnable task if necessary.

  Part 2 has three tasks (B, Y, and Z) taking turns to lock a mutex whose priority ceiling is higher than all of theirs, but lower than that of the highest-priority task (A).

  Part 3 has two tasks (B, Y) competing on a mutex whose priority ceiling is higher than both of theirs, in the midst of which a third task (Z) interacts with a mutex whose priority ceiling lies between the task priorities of (B) and (Y).
  Both mutexes' priority ceilings are lower than that of the highest-priority task (A).
  All three tasks (B, Y, Z) intermittently wake the highest-priority task (A) to show that it is prioritized above all others regardless of other tasks' acquisition of either of the two mutexes.

  Part 4 demonstrates a lock attempt on a mutex by task (B) timing out due to task (A) not unlocking the mutex until after the requested timeout has expired.

  Part 5 demonstrates a lock attempt on a mutex by task (B) succeeding before its timeout due to task (A) unlocking the mutex within the requested time.

  Part 6 has one task (A) lock a mutex whose priority ceiling is lower than its task priority, which is illegal.
  This triggers a fatal error.

The following is the expected output of the Phact mutex demo:

    Part 0: Solo

    a: taking lock
    a: trying held lock
    a: releasing lock
    a: trying unheld lock

`sem-demo`
=================

This system demonstrates semaphore functionality on variants that support priority scheduling:

  Part 0 has one task (A) demonstrate posting (denoted `V`) and trying to wait (denoted `P`) on a semaphore, as well as returning immediately from waiting on a semaphore that has already been posted.

  Part 1 has a lower-priority task (B) unblock a higher-priority task (A) by posting to a semaphore that task (A) is blocked waiting on.
  It also shows the basic property of semaphores that (A) can only wait the same number of times (B) has posted to the semaphore, before a wait attempt would block (A).

  Part 2 shows that if two tasks are both blocked waiting on a semaphore, the higher priority task (A) will be woken in preference to the lower priority task (B) when some other task (Z) posts to the semaphore, regardless of whether task (A) or task (B) attempted to wait on the semaphore first.

  Part 3 demonstrates a wait attempt on a semaphore by task (A) timing out due to task (B) not posting to the semaphore until after the requested timeout has expired.

  Part 4 demonstrates a wait attempt on a semaphore by task (A) succeeding before its timeout due to task (B) posting to the semaphore within the requested time.

  Part 5 demonstrates that if the user posts to the semaphore more times than the runtime-initialized maximum value, the RTOS will trigger a fatal error.

For RTOS variants that do not support semaphore timeouts, parts 3 and 4 can be disabled by setting the optional `timeout_tests` option to `false` when configuring this module in the system `.prx` file.

There is no LED activity in this system, only debug prints via GDB.
The following is the expected output of the semaphore demo, continuing from a breakpoint set at `rtos_start`:

When run on the Kochab variant, the `deadlock` section of the test is expected to deadlock.
It can be disabled by setting the optional `deadlock_test` option to `false` when configuring this module in the system `.prx` file.


`timer-test`
============

This system features two tasks concurrently exercising the RTOS' runtime timer APIs to configure and make use of timers.

Task A uses two timers: The first, WATCHDOG_A, is configured to cause a fatal error exactly one tick after the expected duration of the main body of the test.
The second timer, WAKE_A, is configured to reload itself periodically on expiry, and on each expiry to send task A the WAKE signal.

For a fixed number of iterations, task A alternates between waiting for the WAKE signal to arrive, and sleeping for longer than the WAKE_A timer period so that an overflow occurs.
On each "sleeping" iteration, task A calls the `timer_check_overflow` API on the WAKE_A timer to ensure that an overflow indeed occurred, and to clear the overflow state of the timer.

Finally, task A will issue a 1 second sleep, but before the sleep ever completes, the WATCHDOG_A timer should expire and cause a fatal error.

Task B uses one timer, WATCHDOG_B, which is configured to cause a fatal error if it ever expires.
However, task B just sits in a while-forever loop periodically sleeping for a time period just one second short of the expiry, and on each iteration resetting its watchdog, so that it never expires.

The test ends successfully once the fatal error at the end of task A's main body occurs, as long as this happens before the call to `sleep` returns at the end of task A.
After this point the test is over, although the `tick_irq` will continue to come in once every tick period.

The following is the expected output of the timer test, continuing from a breakpoint set at `rtos_start`:

    (gdb) c

This module depends on an external code module to implement `machine_timer_init()` and `machine_timer_clear()` for the platform the test system is to be run on.


`kochab-test`
===============

This system demonstrates the Kochab variant's task preemption functionality.
It features two tasks, A and B, where task A is assigned a higher priority than task B.

The test program also configures a fixed-interval timer interrupt to occur periodically, and supplies an interrupt handler function, `tick_irq`, that fulfils three responsibilities:

1. Firstly, it takes platform-specific action to clear the interrupt pending status with the hardware.
2. Secondly, it raises an interrupt event (which fulfils its role in the test system in waking up A).
3. Finally, it returns true, to indicate that the handler potentially caused a preemption.

Note that in general, a user-supplied interrupt handler function supplied in the system `.prx` configuration MUST be responsible for clearing the hardware condition that caused its interrupt.
Furthermore, if marked `preempting` in the `.prx`, it MUST return a true boolean value if the handler on that run made an action that has the potential to cause a preemption, such as raising an irq event.

Kochab's expected behaviour is to *preempt* the currently running task if an interrupt handler raises an event that causes a higher-priority task to become runnable.
In other words, the RTOS should immediately context switch to the higher-priority task.
This should occur regardless of whether any lower-priority task is currently running, or blocked.

In the first section, task A sends a number of signals to B that are meant to unblock task B, but A should continue to run because it is of a higher priority than B.

After printing "A now waiting for ticks", A goes into a loop where it waits on a signal set that is only delivered whenever an interrupt event is raised by the timer interrupt event handler.
Whenever it receives this signal, it prints "tick" and sends a signal to wake up B.

With task A waiting on interrupt events, lower-priority task B now comes alive, and goes into a loop where it takes turns busy-waiting (via a loop that calls `signal_poll_set`), and waiting (via `signal_wait_set`) on the signal sent by A.

The `kochab-test` program's expected output is as follows:

    Starting RTOS
    task a: taking lock
    task a: releasing lock
    task a
    unblocking b
    task a
    task a
    task a
    task a
    task a
    unblocking b
    task a
    task a
    task a
    task a
    A now waiting for ticks
    tick
    task b: attempting lock
    task b: got lock
    task b blocking
    tick
    task b unblocked
    tick
    (...)


`fp-test`
==========

This system tests that floating-point values in use by a task remain consistent across a context switch.

More specifically, it is designed to catch inconsistencies that might arise due to a faulty implementation of the floating-point context switch support, under the assumption that int values are preserved correctly by the context switch.

It does this by interleaving:

- a free-running task B that continually increments its floating-point value(s)

- a timer tick-driven task A that decrements its floating-point value(s) whenever it is scheduled

- a timer tick-driven task Z that zeroes out all non-floating-point register values whenever it is scheduled.

Whenever modifying one of its floating-point values, tasks A and B will likewise modify a companion int value, and check that the value of the int (cast to the appropriate floating-point type) matches that of its companion float/double.
If the values do not match, the test will print information on the mismatch and cause a fatal error.

The range of values covered is arbitrarily limited in order to ensure that corresponding float-int value pairs are reset at the same time so that their comparison remains meaningful.
The test will continue (resetting values when necessary) until the user manually shuts the system down.

For platforms or system configurations that only support or wish to use single-precision floating point, the use of double-precision floating point in the test can be disabled by setting the `doubles_test` option to `false` when configuring this module in the system `.prx` file.
