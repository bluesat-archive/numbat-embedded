The GPCB v2 has 8 total accessible ADC inputs. The following is a list
that describes the mapping from the enums used in the ADC library to the
GPIO port/pin label. Cross referencing this with the GPCB schematic should
allow you to identify the physical locations of the input pins and connectors.

Generic PCB:
    AIN0 => PE3
    AIN1 => PE2
    AIN2 => PE1
    AIN3 => PE0
    AIN4 => PD7
    AIN5 => PD6
    AIN6 => PD5
    AIN7 => PD4

Tiva test boards:
    AIN0 => PE3
    AIN1 => PE2
    AIN2 => PE1
    AIN3 => PE0
    AIN4 => PB7
    AIN5 => PB6
    AIN6 => PB5
    AIN7 => PB4
