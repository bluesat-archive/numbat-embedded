I2C sensors (colour, temperature, magnetism):
SCL - PB2
SDA - PB3
SCL and SDA both must be connected to supply via pullup resistors (2-10K)

Moisture sensor:
SIG - AIN0 (PE3)

Weight amplifier:
CLK - PA6
DOUT - PA7
Weight sensor needs to be calibrated - tare to zero out reading.
Find difference in reading between two known weights to determine the scaling factor for units.
